							<p className={styles.handwritten}>Hey, I'm Jacklyn! 👋</p>
							<p>I'm a developer advocate, lover of sharks, and always in search of opportunities to help newbies break into tech.</p>
							<p>Currently, I'm working as a Developer Relations Lead at <a href="https://autocode.com">Autocode</a> where I empower young developers to make Discord Bots, APIs and more! You might have seen one of my <a href="https://youtube.com/autocodetv">tutorial videos</a> or <a href="https://autocode.com/community/tags/tutorial/">read one of my guides</a> if you're coming over to this website from Autocode.</p>
							<p>On the side, I support students running hackathons through <a href="https://mlh.io">Major League Hacking</a>. If you've ever listened to someone explaining the Code of Conduct at a Canadian hackathon, there's a decent chance the person on the stage was me!</p>
							<p>I'm originally from the UK (but not from London - there's other cities, I promise), and I currently live in Toronto, Canada where I spend an embarrasingly large amount of time drinking Tim Hortons and running away from Canada geese.</p>
							<p>If you're looking for someone to speak at an event, help mentor new programmers or just want to chat, please feel free to <Link href="./contact">get in touch</Link>!</p>
							<p>Chat soon!</p>
